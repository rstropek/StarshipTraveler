# Starship Traveler Blazor Demo

![Screenshot](starship-travel.gif)

I created this demo app for the [DevOne 2019 conference](https://devone.at). It has been updated for my Blazor sessions at [Techorama Belgium 2019](https://techorama.be/), [.NET Day Switzerland](https://dotnetday.ch/), and the [*International JavaScript Conferences* in London and Munich](https://javascript-conference.com/), Webinar for [M&F Engineering, Switzerland](https://www.m-f.ch/events/event/29-webinare/73-webframeworks-webinar_2021). It showcases the capabilities of the ASP.NET Core Blazor framework.

**Note** that this sample will not be continuously maintained. I will update it every now and then whenever I use it in workshops and/or conference talks. If you update and/or extend it, feel free to send me a pull request.

## Run the Full Demo

* Install *Blazor* by installing *Visual Studio Preview*.

* Clone the repository.

* Open the solution [StarshipTraveler.sln](StarshipTraveler.sln) and run it.

## Replay Demo?

Do you want to try the demo yourself? Here is what you do:

* Install *Blazor* by installing *Visual Studio Preview*.

* Clone the repository.

* Start the [API project](StarshipTraveler.Api) because the Blazor frontend consumes this Web API. **Note** that you should run the Web API as a console app. Don't start the API in IIS as this can lead to CORS issues.

* Open the solution in the [*Start*](Start) folder.

* Follow the steps mentioned in [*storyboard.md*](storyboard.md). You will find the files referenced there in the [*Assets*](Assets) folder.
